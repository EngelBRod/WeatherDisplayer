- This project has been created using the openweather API for weather.
- Entry of cities is dynamic, having by default the city of New York.
- The API requires latitude and longitude to be able to locate the city dynamically.
- Mapbox was used to obtain the latitude and longitude of the specified cities.
- For the design of the application, React.JS, Bootstrap and SCSS were used as preprocessor
